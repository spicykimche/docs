## Required Variables

The values for these variables will be provided when you onboard with Kimtrace.
```
KIMTRACE_ACCESS_KEY_ID = '<required>'
KIMTRACE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = '<required>'
KIMTRACE_REGION = '<required>'
KIMTRACE_SQS_URL = '<required>'
KIMTRACE_CLIENT_ID = '<required>'

## [OPTIONAL] emergency configuration, "true" will disable Kimtrace, and "false" or null will enable it. Useful when a Kimtrace regression is causing an outage on your service. 
#KIMTRACE_DISABLE = true
```

The `KIMTRACE_DISABLE` variable is **optional** and defaults to `false`. When this is set to `true`, Kimtrace will not be enabled. This is to provide a quick failsafe in case of a regression to avoid requiring a redeployment.
