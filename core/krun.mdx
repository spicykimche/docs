## Properties

<ResponseField name="runName" type="string" required>
Name of the run that will be used to identify which use-case the run belongs to.

Example: `"Transaction.process"`

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="runId" type="string">
Unique identifier for the run. If not provided, a random UUID will be generated. Set this if you want to associate a run with an upstream identifier like a `requestId`. That way, you can quickly query for runs based on `requestId` from KimTrace.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="tags" type="string[]">
Parameters that are part of the `kRun` function/method that you want to tag the value of. You will then be able to filter your runs based on these tags.

Example: `["userId"]`

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="redactors" type="string[]">
Values associated with these parameters will be `[REDACTED]` from the result emitted to KimTrace. Useful for redacting sensitive information that you dont' want stored with your traces.

Example: `["secretKey"]`

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="emitOnlyOnFailure" type="boolean">
By default, all runs are emitted to KimTrace regardless of state. You can set this to `true` to only emit runs that fail. Useful if you want to optimize your token usage and are only interested in errors.

Since this is on a per-run basis, it provides you flexibility to emit runs that only fail for some runs but not others.

</ResponseField>

## Decorator

You can use the `@kRun` decorator to wrap your class methods. This will ensure that each time this class method is called, it will be traced.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Typescript
import { kRun } from "kimtrace";

class TransactionProcessor {
    @kRun({runName: "Transaction.process"})
    public static async processTransaction(params:  {amount: number, type: string, account_id: string}) {
        // ... code here
    }
}
```

```python Python
from kimtrace import KRunParams, kRun

class TransactionProcessor:
    @staticmethod
    @kRun(KRunParams(run_name="Transaction.process"))
    async def process_transaction(amount: float, type_: str, account_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # ... code here
```

</CodeGroup>

## Wrapper

You can use `kRunWrapper` to wrap your function calls and defer the execution until a later time. At any point you call this wrapped function, it will be traced.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Typescript
import { kRunWrapper } from "kimtrace";

async function run() {
    const wrappedCall = kRunWrapper({runName: "Transaction.process"}, processTransaction);
    return await wrappedCall({amount: 3, type: "deposit", account_id: "123"});
}

async function processTransaction(params:  {amount: number, type: string, account_id: string}) {
    // ... code here
}
```

```python Python
from kimtrace import KRunParams, krun_wrapper

async def main() -> Dict[str, Any]:
    wrapped_fn = krun_wrapper(
        KRunParams(run_name="Transaction.process"),
        process_transaction
    )
    return await wrapped_fn(amount=3, type_="deposit", account_id="123")

async def process_transaction(amount: float, type_: str, account_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # ... code here
```

</CodeGroup>

## Wrapped Call

You can use `kRunWrappedCall` to wrap your function and immediately execute it with tracing enabled.

<Note>
For `python`, there's `krun_wrapped_call` and `async_krun_wrapped_call`. Please make sure to use the `async` version if you're using `async` functions.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Typescript
import { kRunWrappedCall } from "kimtrace";

async function run() {
    return await kRunWrappedCall(
        {runName: "Transaction.process"}, 
        processTransaction,
        {amount: 3, type: "deposit", account_id: "123"}
    );
}

async function processTransaction(params:  {amount: number, type: string, account_id: string}) {
    // ... code here
}
```

```python Python
from kimtrace import KRunParams, async_krun_wrapped_call

async def main() -> Dict[str, Any]:
    return await async_krun_wrapped_call(
        KRunParams(run_name="Transaction.process"),
        process_transaction,
        amount=3,
        type_="deposit",
        account_id="123"
    )

async def process_transaction(amount: float, type_: str, account_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # ... code here
```
